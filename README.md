## The cookbook:
  - For full configuration, setup three servers. Synology (or Raspberry#0): main Domoticz server, Raspberry#1: backup Domoticz server and Raspberry#2: dedicated Alarm server. Lite configuration can include for example only the main server (neither cluster feature nor alarm server). Mandatory software:
     - MQTT for the two Domoticz servers. On Raspbian Jessie:
     ```
         - wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
         - sudo apt-key add mosquitto-repo.gpg.key
         - cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
         - sudo wget http://repo.mosquitto.org/debian/mosquitto-jessie.list
         - sudo apt-get update
         - sudo apt-cache search mosquitto
         - sudo apt-get install mosquitto
     ```    
     - Node.js for all three (version greater than 6 for the two Raspberry#1 and #2) with packages mqtt (all), ssh2 (Raspberry#1), epoll and rpi-gpio (Raspberry#2):  
     ```
         - sudo apt-get update
         - sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
         - curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
         - sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
         - npm install mqtt
         - npm install ssh2
         - npm install epoll
         - npm install rpi-gpio
     ```    
     - nginx for Raspberry#1 (and Raspberry#0 if main server is not Synology). To install latest nginx (1.10.3) and ssl version on Raspbian Jessie:
     ```
         - sudo apt-get update
         - sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
         - sudo bash -c 'cat << EOF >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nginx.list
         -   deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports main contrib non-free
         - EOF' 
         - gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key  8B48AD6246925553      
         - gpg -a --export 8B48AD6246925553 | sudo apt-key add -
         - gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key  7638D0442B90D010      
         - gpg -a --export 7638D0442B90D010 | sudo apt-key add -
         - sudo apt-get update     
         - sudo apt-get install -t jessie-backports nginx
         - sudo apt-get install -t jessie-backports openssl  
     ```    
  - Install motionEye in the dedicated Alarm server. On Raspbian Jessie:
     ```
     - sudo apt-get update

     ``` 
  - Time to use Domoticz...Enter in the main and backup Domoticz instances the heating zone schedules. To start or stop a heating zone at a given hour, you have to enter in Timers of Heating Schedule/Start or Heating Schedule/Stop devices the command ON on Time for the level corresponding to the heating zone. In the backup server, I've entered schedules to send every hour a start to all heating zones.
